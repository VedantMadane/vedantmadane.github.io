I like learning languages - both natual and programming. 
Talk to me in tounges:

  **Sanskrit**: can listen and understand but cannot speak without making mistakes.
  **Russian**: literate yet my eyes begin to roll when I see blocks of text in Cyrillic.
  Fluent in **Marathi**, **Hindi** and **English**. 

All languages are imperfect, except Sanskrit.
So here I try to document how to say interesting things in them.
If you know a better way of doing what I'm trying to do, then let me know!
