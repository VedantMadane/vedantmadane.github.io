I like learning languages - both natual and otherwise.
Talk to me in tounges:

  **Sanskrit**: can listen and understand but cannot speak without making mistakes.
  
  **Russian**: conversant yet my eyes begin to roll when I see blocks of text in Cyrillic.
  
   ̶F̶l̶u̶e̶n̶t̶ Literate in **Marathi**, **Hindi** and **English**. 

All languages are imperfect, except Sanskrit.
So here I try to document how to say interesting things in them.
If you know a better way of doing what I'm trying to do, then let me know!
