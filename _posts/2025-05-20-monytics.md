title: Questions to Answer Before Re/Investing through Moneytics
---
When I first invested through Moneytics, it was called LendPartnerz.  
Then it was rebranded again and that time, it was called Alt Groww.   
Since then its inception, has gone through rebranding exercises not once but twice.  
When it became AltGroww, I emailed them asking for a reason for this change:   

> Why was the website address changed from lend partnerz to alt grow?

Here is the reply I got:  

Hello Vedant,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding our recent rebranding from Lend Partnerz to Alt Groww.

 

This change is a strategic move that aligns with our evolving vision to expand our horizons, particularly in real estate financing. Over the past few years, we have seen significant opportunities in these sectors, and we felt that our previous identity no longer fully encapsulated our broader ambitions. Here’s the rationale behind this transition:

 

Expanding Our Real Estate Portfolio

As Lend Partnerz, we initially focused on lending solutions. However, with the growing demand for alternative financing options in the real estate market, we are positioning ourselves as a more comprehensive player in this space. Under the Alt Groww banner, we are enhancing our services to cater to a wider range of real estate investments, making it easier for our partners to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

 

A Future-Focused Vision

The name "Alt Groww" reflects our broader ambition: to be a platform for alternative growth solutions. This rebranding symbolizes our move beyond niche lending, offering investors and clients a dynamic array of financial products and services. We are committed to exploring new avenues that foster growth, while maintaining the same trust and reliability that have always been our hallmark.

 

By transitioning to Alt Groww, we aim to better communicate the breadth of our capabilities and align our brand with the innovative strategies that will drive us forward in both real estate and media invoice discounting.

 

We are confident that this change positions us for long-term success and creates more value for our investors. Should you have any further questions or require additional details, please feel free to reach out.

 

Thank you for your continued support.


Thanks & Regards

The LendPartnerz website went down after that.

To which I replied, 

> Who acquired whom?

I did not receive a reply to my question.  

Additionally, the vendor name to which the money is going to is not shown, so you have no recourse on the vendor in case things go wrong.  

When I asked
> Are you a Ponzi Scheme?

I got no reply.

Their mails have no unsubscribe link embedded in it. Likely they were sending the emails in bulk to their entire mailing list kept in cc/bcc. So I said

> if you don't unsubscribe me I will report you as spam

To which I got the following reply from Monytics:

> You’ve been unsubscribed — consider it done.
> 
> We don’t believe in forcing value where it’s not wanted.
> No spam, no stress — just clean exits.
> 
> If you change your mind, the door’s open.
> Until then, take care.
> Thanks & Regards
