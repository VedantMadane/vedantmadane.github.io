Good morning,
This new month brings with it more opportunities for business expansion.
Annual Maintenance Contract  of Cotton Corporation of India Website
Just 6 kilometer away from MKCL's branch office at Seawoods, is the head office 'Kapas Bhavan' of the Cotton Corporation of India.
Their website is https://cotcorp.org.in/ which they are looking forward to maintaining.
We qualify all their criteria, especially the one requiring the tenderer to have a development/support office located in Navi Mumbai.
It behooves us to pay them a visit in order to understand their expectations.
I'm sure they would like MKCL, which has an office in such close proximity to them, to maintain their website.
