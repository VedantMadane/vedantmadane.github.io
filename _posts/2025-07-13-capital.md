# The Pecking Order Theory of capital structure implies a unique optimum capital structure.

    True
    False
    **False.** The Pecking Order Theory of capital structure does **not** imply a unique optimum capital structure.

Instead, the Pecking Order Theory suggests that firms follow a **hierarchy of financing preferences**: they prefer to use internal funds first, then debt, and issue equity only as a last resort[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7][^1_9]. This behavior is driven by concerns about information asymmetry and the relative costs of different financing sources, not by a search for a specific, unique optimal mix of debt and equity[^1_1][^1_7][^1_9]. As a result, the actual capital structure observed in a company is the outcome of cumulative financing decisions over time, rather than the result of targeting a precise, optimal capital structure[^1_1][^1_6][^1_7][^1_9].

In contrast, theories like the Trade-off Theory explicitly seek an **optimal capital structure** that minimizes the cost of capital and maximizes firm value[^1_7][^1_11]. The Pecking Order Theory, however, does not provide a quantitative rule or target ratio for debt and equity, and therefore does not imply a unique optimum capital structure[^1_6][^1_7][^1_9].

# A company has net income of \$20,000 and a tax rate of 35 percent. Its total debt is \$25,000, with principal payments of \$5,000 due at the end of each year and an annual interest rate of 8%. What will be the company's interest tax shield in the upcoming year?

    $8,750
    $700
    $9,450
    $2,450
    The **interest tax shield** is calculated as the **interest expense multiplied by the tax rate**[^2_1][^2_3][^2_5][^2_7].

Given:

- **Total debt**: \$25,000
- **Annual interest rate**: 8%
- **Tax rate**: 35%

First, calculate the **annual interest expense**:

$$
\text{Interest Expense} = \$25,000 \times 8\% = \$2,000
$$

Now, calculate the **interest tax shield**:

$$
\text{Interest Tax Shield} = \$2,000 \times 35\% = \$700
$$

So, the company's interest tax shield in the upcoming year will be **\$700**[^2_1][^2_3][^2_5].

# The cost of capital for an all-equity-financed company that pays no dividends is zero.

    True
    False
    **False.** The cost of capital for an all-equity-financed company that pays no dividends is **not zero**.

Even if a company does not pay dividends, **equity investors still require a return** for investing their capital, reflecting the opportunity cost and risk of their investment. This required return is known as the **cost of equity**, which can be estimated using models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)[^3_1][^3_4][^3_5][^3_6]. The absence of dividend payments does not eliminate the cost of equity, as investors may expect returns through capital gains or future dividends.

Therefore, an all-equity-financed, no-dividend company still has a **positive cost of capital**, not zero.

# A company has net working capital of \$0, current liabilities of \$25 and total assets equal to \$100. What is its current ratio?

    0.0
    1.0
    0.5
    4.0
    The **current ratio** is calculated as:

$$
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

Given:

- **Net working capital** = Current Assets – Current Liabilities = \$0
- **Current Liabilities** = \$25

So, **Current Assets** must also be \$25.

$$
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{25}{25} = 1.0
$$

The correct answer is **1.0**[^4_2][^4_3][^4_6].

# The item that roughly divides "real" from "financial" activities on an income statement is:

    EBIT
    Interest Expense
    SG&A Expense
    None of the above
    The item that roughly divides **"real" (operating)** from **"financial" (financing)** activities on an income statement is **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**.

- **EBIT** represents profit from the company's core operations, before deducting interest (a financing cost) and taxes.
- Items **above EBIT** (such as revenue, cost of goods sold, and SG\&A expense) are considered part of the company's real, operating activities.
- Items **below EBIT** (such as interest expense) relate to financial activities, like the cost of borrowing[^6_1][^6_3][^6_5].

**Correct answer:** **EBIT**

# The higher the opportunity cost of capital the higher the NPV.

    True
    False
    **False.** The higher the **opportunity cost of capital**, the **lower** the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project, not higher.

This is because NPV is calculated by discounting future cash flows at the opportunity cost of capital. As the discount rate increases, the present value of future cash flows decreases, resulting in a lower NPV[^7_4][^7_6][^7_7].

# You are saving money for a down payment on a house. Suppose you want to have total savings of \$20,000 in 10 years time and you have currently \$5,000. What annual interest rate do you need to earn on your initial investment, assuming you contribute no additional savings?

    10.0%
    18.5%
    12.5%
    15.0%
    To find the **annual interest rate** needed to grow your savings from **\$5,000** to **\$20,000** in **10 years** with no additional contributions, use the **future value formula**:

$$
FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n
$$

Where:

- $FV = 20,000$
- $PV = 5,000$
- $n = 10$
- $r =$ annual interest rate

Plug in the values:

$$
20,000 = 5,000 \times (1 + r)^{10}
$$

$$
\frac{20,000}{5,000} = (1 + r)^{10}
$$

$$
4 = (1 + r)^{10}
$$

Take the 10th root of both sides:

$$
1 + r = 4^{1/10}
$$

$$
1 + r \approx 1.1487
$$

$$
r \approx 0.1487 \text{ or } 14.87\%
$$

The closest answer choice is **15.0%**[^8_1][^8_6][^8_9][^8_10].

### Analysis of Claims for Grandma's Applesauce, Inc.

#### Given Data

- **Probability of Good Year:** 0.60
    - **Operating Cash Flow (Good Year):** \$50,000
- **Probability of Bad Year:** 0.40
    - **Operating Cash Flow (Bad Year):** \$30,000
- **Debt Outstanding:** \$35,000
- **Interest Rate:** 8%
- **Interest Due Next Year:** \$2,800 (\$35,000 × 8%)
- **Total Due to Creditors Next Year:** \$37,800 (\$35,000 + \$2,800)
- **Tax Rate:** 0%
- **No other means to service debt except operating cash flow**


#### Step-by-Step Calculation

| Scenario | Probability | Operating Cash Flow | Amount Due to Creditors | Creditors' Claim (min of cash flow or due) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Good Year | 0.60 | \$50,000 | \$37,800 | \$37,800 |
| Bad Year | 0.40 | \$30,000 | \$37,800 | \$30,000 |

- **Expected Creditors' Claim:**

$$
(0.60 \times 37,800) + (0.40 \times 30,000) = 22,680 + 12,000 = \$34,680
$$
- **Expected Shareholders' Claim:**
    - Expected Operating Cash Flow:

$$
(0.60 \times 50,000) + (0.40 \times 30,000) = 30,000 + 12,000 = \$42,000
$$
- Less: Expected Creditors' Claim (\$34,680)
- $$
\$42,000 - \$34,680 = \$7,320
$$


### Correct Answer

- **Creditors expected claim is \$34,680.**

This matches the third answer choice. The other options are not correct based on the calculations above.

# Which is a commonly used proxy for the "risk-free rate"?

    The average historical interest rate on long-term government bonds
    The current market rate interest rate on a government-insured savings account
    The current yield to maturity on a long-term government bond
    The rate of return on a low volatility stock
    The **current yield to maturity on a long-term government bond** is a commonly used proxy for the "risk-free rate"[^10_3][^10_4][^10_7][^10_8]. This is because government bonds, especially those issued by stable governments (such as U.S. Treasury bonds), are considered to have negligible default risk and are widely accepted as the closest practical approximation of a risk-free investment.

    the equity market risk premium is 5.0%; and
    the beta of the stock is 1.2.
    
    11.1%
    6.1%
    6.0%

\text{Risk Premium} = \beta \times (\text{Equity Market Risk Premium})
$$

Given:

- **Beta** = 1.2
- **Equity Market Risk Premium** = 5.0%

So,

# The sustainable growth rate is the maximum growth rate achievable over an extended period of time.

    True
    False
    **True.** The sustainable growth rate is defined as the **maximum growth rate that a company can sustain over an extended period of time** without needing to raise additional external financing (debt or equity), relying only on internally generated resources[^12_2][^12_5][^12_6]. This rate reflects how quickly a company can grow while maintaining its current capital structure and financial policies.

# What is the expected return on a risky investment where

    the risk free rate is 5.1%;
    the investment's beta is 1.4;
    the equity market risk premium is 5.0%; and
    the cost of debt is 4.5%.
    
    10.8%
    9.6%
    12.1%
    9.2%
    To find the **expected return** on a risky investment using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), use the formula:

$$
\text{Expected Return} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \beta \times (\text{Equity Market Risk Premium})
$$

Given:

- **Risk-free rate:** 5.1%
- **Beta:** 1.4
- **Equity market risk premium:** 5.0%

Plug in the values:

$$
\text{Expected Return} = 5.1\% + 1.4 \times 5.0\% = 5.1\% + 7.0\% = 12.1\%
$$

The correct answer is **12.1%**[^13_1][^13_2][^13_3][^13_4][^13_5][^13_7].

*Note: The cost of debt is not relevant to this CAPM calculation.*

# Which of the following are sources of funds in a statement of sources and uses?

     I. Collection of accounts receivables
     II. Reduction of long-term debt
     III. Payment of dividends
     IV. Reduction in the cash account
    
    I only
    II and III
    III and IV
    I and IV
    Among the options provided, the **collection of accounts receivables** is a source of funds, because it represents cash inflow from customers paying their outstanding balances[^14_2][^14_6][^14_7].

- **Reduction of long-term debt** and **payment of dividends** are uses of funds, as they represent outflows.
- **Reduction in the cash account** is also a use of funds, as it means cash is being spent or moved out.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I only**

# The Pecking Order Theory of capital structure rests on an assumption of

    agency costs.
    barriers to entry.
    asymmetric information.
    tax shields and cost of financial distress.
    The Pecking Order Theory of capital structure rests on an assumption of **asymmetric information**. This theory proposes that managers have more information about the firm's prospects and value than outside investors, leading to a hierarchy in financing choices: internal funds first, then debt, and equity as a last resort[^15_1][^15_2][^15_3][^15_5].

# Common-size financial statements are constructed in order to:

    To comply with SEC requirements
    All of the above
    Common-size financial statements are constructed primarily to **facilitate comparisons of different-sized companies**. By expressing each line item as a percentage of a common base figure (such as total assets or total revenue), these statements allow analysts and investors to compare the financial structure and performance of companies regardless of their absolute size, and to identify trends over time or benchmark against industry peers[^16_1][^16_3][^16_5][^16_6].

There is **no requirement** to use common-size statements for SEC compliance, and they are not designed to adjust for inflation or risk[^16_3][^16_5].

The correct answer is:
**Facilitate comparisons of different-sized companies**

# 41.

Common-size financial statements are constructed in order to:

    Adjust for inflation and risk
    Facilitate comparisons of different-sized companies
    To comply with SEC requirements
    All of the above
    The primary purpose of **common-size financial statements** is to **facilitate comparisons of different-sized companies** by expressing each line item as a percentage of a common base (such as total assets or total sales). This standardization allows analysts and investors to compare financial performance and structure across companies of varying sizes and over time, identify trends, and benchmark against industry averages.

- They do **not** adjust for inflation or risk.
- They are **not** required by the SEC.
- Their main benefit is enabling **meaningful comparisons and trend analysis**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Facilitate comparisons of different-sized companies**[^17_1][^17_2][^17_3][^17_4][^17_5][^17_6].

# The cost of debt is generally lower than the cost of equity.

    True
    False
    **True.** The cost of debt is generally lower than the cost of equity. This is because debt holders take on less risk than equity investors, have priority in repayment, and because interest payments on debt are often tax-deductible, reducing the effective cost to the company[^18_1][^18_3][^18_5][^18_7][^18_9]. Equity investors require a higher return to compensate for their higher risk and residual claim on assets.

# 39.

Which of the following is commonly forecasted as a percent of sales:

    Common stock
    Gross profit
    Long-term debt
    Revolving credit
    The item that is **commonly forecasted as a percent of sales** is **gross profit**. The percentage-of-sales method is typically applied to items like **cost of goods sold, gross profit, accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and various expenses** that vary with sales[^19_1][^19_2][^19_3][^19_5][^19_7]. Common stock and long-term debt are generally not forecasted as a percent of sales, as they do not directly correlate with sales volume.

The correct answer is:

**Gross profit**

# The cash cycle measures the days required to produce finished goods or delivered services.

    True
    False
    **False.** The cash cycle (or cash conversion cycle) does **not** measure just the days required to produce finished goods or delivered services. Instead, it measures the total number of days it takes for a company to convert its investment in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. This includes:

- The time to produce or acquire inventory,
- The time to sell inventory,
- The time to collect accounts receivable,
- Minus the time the company takes to pay its suppliers.

So, the cash cycle tracks the entire process from paying for inventory to collecting cash from customers, not just production or service delivery days[^20_1][^20_2][^20_3][^20_4][^20_5].

# An increase in financial leverage generally results in a higher return on equity (ROE).

    True
    False
    **False.** An increase in financial leverage does **not always** result in a higher return on equity (ROE). While using more debt can increase ROE if the company's return on assets exceeds the cost of debt (a positive leverage effect), it also increases the risk and the variability of both net income and ROE. If the cost of debt exceeds the returns generated, leverage can actually decrease ROE[^21_1][^21_2][^21_9]. Therefore, the relationship depends on the relative returns and costs, not simply on the use of leverage.

# A company builds a new plant and finances its construction by issuing stock. Which ratio is least likely to be affected, all else being equal?

    Current ratio
    Debt to equity ratio
    Debt to asset ratio
    Net fixed assets to total assets
    When a company builds a new plant and finances it by **issuing stock**, the following changes occur:

- **Current ratio**: Issuing stock increases cash (a current asset), but building a plant converts that cash into fixed assets (non-current). Ultimately, current assets return to their original level, so the current ratio is **least likely to be affected**.
- **Debt to equity ratio**: Equity increases due to the new stock, so this ratio changes.
- **Debt to asset ratio**: Total assets increase (the new plant), and equity increases, so this ratio changes.
- **Net fixed assets to total assets**: Net fixed assets increase (the plant), and total assets increase, so this ratio changes.

**Therefore, the current ratio is least likely to be affected, all else being equal.**

# The owners of a firm facing a high probability of bankruptcy prefer to invest in ____ projects, because ______.

    safer; riskier projects make bankruptcy more likely
    no new; the firm is likely to go bankrupt anyway
    risky; the shareholders have little to lose and might win if successful
    risky; creditors prefer taking a gamble rather than having the company default
    The correct answer is:

**risky; the shareholders have little to lose and might win if successful**

Owners (shareholders) of a firm facing a high probability of bankruptcy prefer to invest in **risky projects** because if the project succeeds, they benefit from the upside, but if it fails, their losses are limited to what they have already invested. This is due to the asymmetric payoff structure in bankruptcy situations: creditors are paid first, and shareholders only get what remains (if anything). Thus, shareholders have an incentive to "gamble for resurrection" when bankruptcy is likely, as they have little left to lose and could gain substantially if the risky project succeeds[^23_2][^23_6].

# In general, an increase in a liability is a source of funds.

    True
    False
    **True.** An increase in a liability is generally considered a **source of funds** because it means the company has obtained additional financing or credit without immediately using cash. For example, borrowing money or increasing accounts payable increases liabilities and provides cash or resources, thus serving as a source of funds[^24_1][^24_5][^24_7].

This is consistent with the accounting and cash flow principles where:

- An increase in liabilities (like loans or accounts payable) brings in cash or resources.
- A decrease in liabilities (repayment of debt or payables) uses cash and is a use of funds.

Therefore, an increase in a liability is generally a source of funds.

# A project with an internal rate of return greater than the cost of capital should always be accepted.

    True
    False
    **False.**
A project with an internal rate of return (IRR) greater than the cost of capital is generally considered acceptable because it indicates the project is expected to generate returns above the minimum required by investors[^25_1][^25_4][^25_5][^25_6]. However, it should **not always be accepted** without further analysis. There are several important limitations to relying solely on IRR:

- **Mutually exclusive projects:** The project with the highest IRR may not have the highest net present value (NPV), so NPV should also be considered[^25_3][^25_6].
- **Non-conventional cash flows:** Projects with multiple changes in cash flow direction can result in multiple IRRs, making interpretation difficult[^25_1][^25_6].
- **Scale of investment:** IRR does not account for the size of the project, which can lead to misleading decisions when comparing projects of different scales[^25_3][^25_6].

Thus, while IRR > cost of capital is a useful rule of thumb, it is **not an absolute rule** and should be used alongside other investment appraisal methods.

# Biases can and should always be eliminated in financial forecasts.

    True
    False
    **False.**
Biases in financial forecasts can be **reduced** through structured processes, data-driven methods, and technology, but they **cannot always be completely eliminated**. Human judgment, incentives, and external pressures can introduce bias, and even with advanced tools and best practices, some level of subjectivity or error may persist[^26_1][^26_3][^26_5][^26_7].

# The Static Tradeoff theory of capital structure implies that firms with higher business risk should have lower leverage.

    True
    False
    **True.**
The Static Tradeoff theory of capital structure states that firms balance the tax benefits of debt (the interest tax shield) against the costs of financial distress, including bankruptcy and agency costs, to determine their optimal capital structure[^27_1][^27_2][^27_5]. Firms with **higher business risk** (greater variability in operating income) face a higher probability of financial distress for any given level of debt. As a result, the optimal capital structure for these firms involves **lower leverage** compared to firms with lower business risk, since the costs of financial distress rise more quickly for them[^27_2][^27_5].

# GoodTimes, Inc. has asset turnover of 0.5 times, a net profit margin of 10% and average total assets of \$100, what is its net income (assuming no unusual items)?

    $50
    $500
    $5
    The answer cannot be determined with the information provided.
    Given:

- **Asset turnover** = 0.5 times
- **Net profit margin** = 10%
- **Average total assets** = \$100

Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Asset turnover** = Revenue / Average total assets
Revenue = Asset turnover × Average total assets = 0.5 × \$100 = **\$50**
2. **Net profit margin** = Net income / Revenue
Net income = Net profit margin × Revenue = 10% × \$50 = **\$5**

So, the net income is **\$5**.

**Correct answer: \$5**

# An optimal current ratio should be greater than 1.0.

    True
    False
    **True.**
An optimal current ratio is generally considered to be **greater than 1.0**, as this indicates that a company's current assets exceed its current liabilities and it should be able to meet its short-term obligations[^29_1][^29_3][^29_7]. Most financial experts and banks consider a current ratio above 1.0 (often in the range of 1.2 to 2.0 or higher, depending on the industry) to be acceptable or optimal, as it provides a cushion against liquidity risk[^29_1][^29_2][^29_5][^29_7]. However, the ideal ratio can vary by industry, and a very high current ratio may signal inefficient use of assets[^29_1][^29_2][^29_7].

# Which of the following are equivalent under M\&M proposition I?

    Maximizing firm value and maximizing firm profit
    Maximizing firm value and minimizing the cost of capital
    Minimizing firm's cost of capital and minimizing firm's debt burden
    Maximizing profit and minimizing taxes
    Under **M\&M Proposition I** (Modigliani-Miller Proposition I), the key insight is that **the value of a firm is independent of its capital structure**—that is, it does not matter whether the firm is financed by debt, equity, or a mix of both; the firm's value remains the same in perfect markets without taxes, bankruptcy costs, or asymmetric information[^30_1][^30_2][^30_3][^30_4][^30_5][^30_7][^30_9][^30_10].

This means that:

- **Maximizing firm value** and **minimizing the cost of capital** are equivalent under M\&M Proposition I, because the firm's value is maximized when its cost of capital is minimized, and vice versa[^30_1][^30_3][^30_4][^30_8][^30_9].

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Maximizing firm value and minimizing the cost of capital**.

# What is the present value of a growing perpetuity that makes a payment of \$100 in the first year, which thereafter grows at 3% per year? Apply a discount rate of 7%.

    $ 2,000
    $ 3,500
    $ 2,500
    $ 4,000
    To calculate the **present value of a growing perpetuity**, use the formula:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{r - g}
$$

Where:

- \$ C \$ = payment in the first year = **\$100**
- \$ r \$ = discount rate = **7%** (0.07)
- \$ g \$ = growth rate = **3%** (0.03)

Plug in the values:

$$
PV = \frac{100}{0.07 - 0.03} = \frac{100}{0.04} = 2,500
$$

The present value is **\$2,500**[^31_1][^31_2][^31_5][^31_7].
