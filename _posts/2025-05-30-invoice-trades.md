title: Questions To Answer Before Investing Through Invoice Trades
---
Pragya Khandelwal only replies "..." to my queries. Vikas Kumar's page on the website is now hidden although he owns this place. But when I asked "Who owns invoice trades", I got the reply "Our Director is Saswat Patra."

Try emailing to support@invoicetrades.com, you will never get a reply. There is no escrow account although they call it as such, so you don't know and will never know where your money is going. There is no trustee to oversee and supervise the flow of funds.

Annexure 1 mentioned but not attached for security guard company VEN00184 live deal ~4Cr deal ID 729. After that there have been no enterprise invoices uploaded so you cannot discern whether it is a PO/BO (purchase order or bill of materials) or reverse invoice discounting going on. There have been only 731 IDs so far but the website will claim 28000 Ids.

When I asked how many people comprise the credit verification team, I got different numbers every time. Pragya Khandelwal said 8 in the queries tab, on call Preeti Sahu said 4-5 and Saswat Patra said 10 on call. They refrain from communicating in writing and from allowing the calls to be recorded.

They hide all deals that have happened before, showing only the last 10. The enterprise and vendor search and dropdowns don't work and there are multiple values for CBRE, Wonder Cement etc. in the Enterprise dropdown.

Anjali Singh sister in law of Yogendra Singh who has been arrested was formerly the director of this company.

There is no  collection department so we just hope and pray for repayment when a vendor delays.
Sometimes same deals go off "accidentally" multiple times like 707 and 708.
Their CAs keeps resigning and they won't tell you why.

If the company is based out of Telengana, why does the Service Level Agreement (SLA) mention the courts of arbitration to be in New Delhi?

Avinash Sakhare, the brother of Vikas Kumar Sakhare, his wife Sneha Jambulkar have a history of floating multiple companies and you don't know if your money is being rotated through them.

Annexure 1 mentioned but not attached for security guard company VEN00184 live deal ~4Cr deal

Enterprise Invoices from Tata Elxsi Limited and Toshiba Missing. This is with reference to deal IDs 731 and 730 raised to anchors Toshiba and Tata Elxsi Limited by vendors BV576036579 and WI202176105 respectively. The enterprise invoices for these have not been uploaded and/or linked yet hence I urge you to provide the same at the earliest so that I can discern whether it is a PO/BO (purchase order or bill of materials) or reverse invoice discounting.

tell me more about the deal delayed by three weeks

Will you stand ground or go into hiding when push comes to shove?

When RBI's TReDs exists, why would vendors use anything else? Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) ?
