title: Questions To Answer Before Investing In RioFin Assets
---

If you really have a warehouse as an asset underneath on the balance sheet then why don't you:

1. Why don't you have an escrow account
2. Please provide a Proof of asset? Please send the proof of assets regarding the warehouse I have invested in / you want me to invest in.
3. Valuation by a SEBI registered valuator? The valuation of the assets , preferably by a SEBI registered valuator 
4. do a charge creation on the warehouse asset and /or land underneath
5. share the name of the individual or company to whom it has been rented out on an operational leased basis
6. Give the valuation report by a real estate valuator on the value of the empty vacant land added value by having constructed a warehouse on it giving the total value of the warehouse
7. SEBI AIF or CIS Registration: Have you crossed this threshold of 90 Cr raised after which you were going to mandatorily register with SEBI?
8. Also send all financial documents including balance sheet to my registered email address
9. Why can't you be more transparent and share some updates regarding who/if the warehouse is occupied/rented by or not. Address of the warehouse. Are you afraid that a random investor will come to pay you a visit or inspect the surroundings of the property?
10. What is the rent charged and how do you manage to provide this instant liquidity? Are you rotating funds between these various LLPs and Pvt Ltd companies and if so what is the nature of these related party transactions?
11. Your three co-founders have no mention on your website and their photos/images/faces are also not shown or their names are not mentioned anywhere...
12. Their website keeps changing domain names and instead of redirecting, the old website goes down. Received this on 11th July 2025, Friday:
