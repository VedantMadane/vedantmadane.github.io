श्रीयमुनाष्टकम्

>भ्रातुरन्तकस्य पत्तनेऽभिपत्तिहारिणी \
प्रेक्षयातिपापिनोऽपि पापसिन्धुतारिणी । \
नीरमाधुरीभिरप्यशेषचित्तबन्धिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ १॥ 

1) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who saves one from having to enter the city of her brother Yamaraja, the sight of whom \
enables the most sinful persons to cross the ocean of sin, and the sweetness of whose water charms the hearts of everyone, always purify me. 

हारिवारिधारयाभिमण्डितोरुखाण्डवा \
पुण्डरीकमण्डलोद्यदण्डजालिताण्डवा । \
स्नानकामपामरोग्रपापसम्पदन्धिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ २॥ 

2) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who decorates the great Khandava forest with a stream of pleasant waters, who is \
filled with lotus flowers and dancing birds, and who blinds the terrible sins of they who desire to bathe in her, always purify me. 

शीकराभिमृष्टजन्तुदुर्विपाकमर्दिनी \
नन्दनन्दनान्तरङ्गभक्तिपूरवर्धिनी । \
तीरसङ्गमाभिलाषिमङ्गलानुबन्धिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ३॥ 

3) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, a drop of whose water destroys the sinful reactions of the people, who creates a great flood of \
confidential pure devotional service to Lord Nandananadana, and who brings auspiciousness to they who desire to live on her shore, always purify me. 

द्वीपचक्रवालजुष्टसप्तसिन्धुभेदिनी \
श्रीमुकुन्दनिर्मितोरुदिव्यकेलिवेदिनी । \
कान्तिकन्दलीभिरिन्द्रनीलवृन्दनिन्दिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ४ ॥ 

4) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who divides the seven oceans and seven continents, who witnessed \
many of Lord Mukunda's transcendental pastimes, and whose splendor rebukes a host of sapphires, always purify me.

माथुरेण मण्डलेन चारुणाभिमण्डिता \
प्रेमनद्धवैष्णवाध्ववर्धनाय पण्डिता । \
ऊर्मिदोर्विलासपद्मनाभपादवन्दिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ५॥ 

5) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who is decorated by the beautiful district of Mathura, who expertly protects they who follow the path of \
loving devotional service, and who with the playful motions of the waves that are her arms offers respectful obeisances to Lord Padmanabha's feet, always purify me. 

रम्यतीररम्भमाणगोकदम्बभूषिता \
दिव्यगन्धभाक्कदम्बपुष्पराजिरूषिता । \
नन्दसूनुभक्तसङ्घसङ्गमाभिनन्दिन\
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ६॥ 

6) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, whose charming shores are decorated with many lowing cows, who is filled with \
many splendid and fragrant kadamba flowers, and who is delighted to have the company of Lord Krsna's devotees, always purify me.

फुल्लपक्षमल्लिकाक्षहंसलक्षकूजिता \
भक्तिविद्धदेवसिद्धकिन्नरालिपूजिता । \
तीरगन्धवाहगन्धजन्मबन्धरन्धिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ७॥ 

7) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who is filled with the warblings of thousands of joyful mallikaksa swans, who is worshiped by the Vaisnavas, \
devas, siddhas, and kinnaras, and the slightest scent of the fragrant breeze moving on whose shores stops the cycle of repeated birth and death, always purify me. 

चिद्विलासवारिपूरभूर्भुवःस्वरापिनी \
कीर्तितापि दुर्मदोरुपापमर्मतापिनी । \
बल्लवेन्द्रनन्दनाङ्गरागभङ्गगन्धिनी \
मां पुनातु सर्वदारविन्दबन्धुनन्दिनी ॥ ८॥ 

8) May Sri Yamuna, who is the daughter of Suryadeva, who is the famous, splendid, spiritual river flowing through the Bhuh, Bhuvah, and Svah \
planets, who burns away the greatest sins, and who is fragrant with scented ointments from Lord Krsna's transcendental body, always purify me. 
 
तुष्टबुद्धिरष्टकेन निर्मलोर्मिचेष्टितां \
त्वामनेन भानुपुत्रि! सर्वदेववेष्टिताम् । \
यःस्तवीति वर्धयस्व सर्वपापमोचने \
भक्तिपूरमस्य देवि! पुण्डरीकलोचने ॥ ९॥ 

9) O lotus-eyed one, O daughter of Suryadeva, O rescuer from all sins, please flood with pure devotional service that person who, reciting \
these eight prayerswith a cheerful heart, glorifies you, whose waves are pure and splendid, and who is accompanied by all the Gods. 

इति श्रीरूपगोस्वामिविरचितस्तवमालायां श्रीयमुनाष्टकं सम्पूर्णम् ।

Thus is completed Shri Yamuna Ashtakam, eight verses about the river Yamuna, contained in the Stavamala, garland of songs book, composed by Shri Rupa Gosvami.
